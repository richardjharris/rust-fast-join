rjoin - rico's join
-------------------

Similar to unix join(1) or gjoin, with the following differences:

 - O(1) memory usage - don't allocate O(n) memory when joining
   files with a large number of matching rows

 - Cross-joins do not generate NxM output rows. There are not
   really supported. (Need to detect them at some point)

 - Join on multiple fields (-l 1,2 -r 1,2)

 - Slightly clearer options: -l/-r to specify join field(s), -L/-R
   to specify an inner join on the left or right side

 - --outer for outer joins (equivalent to -L -R)

 - -j for specifying the key field for both the left and right files
   simultaneously (equivalent to -l X -r X)

 - Supports several output formats:
   -o auto : uses first line to determine column count for each file;
             outputs key field(s) followed by all non-key fields of left,
             then right file. Consistent number of output columns
   
   -o gnudefault : GNU join default: key field, followed by all non-key
             fields of each file. Number of columns may change for each
             output line, depending on input.

   -o 0,1.1,1.2,2.1 : standard GNU join output format

   -o 0,1.1-10,2.2-5 : shorthand for column ranges (new)

 - --left-missing and -right-missing values allow custom placeholder values
   for missing left/right rows when performaing left or right outer joins.

    e.g. --left-missing '[New]' --right-missing '[Expired]'

   This differs from GNU join's -e option, which fills in both missing
   relationship data, and all blank columns in both input files.
 
 - Performance is roughly comparable with GNU join.

Things to think about adding
----------------------------

 * -e EMPTY for replacing missing input fields (useful?)
 * -i ignorecase
 * -t input/output separator
 * -v to do a not-exists join
 * --check-order
 * --header

 Trailing newlines: GNU join behaviour is to consider a trailing newline to be
 a real field, with no columns. It outputs an empty line at the end! We do the
 same, except currently splitline will panic :P
